Online Bookstore Web Page
This project is a simple static webpage for an online bookstore using modern web development practices. The webpage includes a navigation sidebar, a header with the college name, and dynamically loaded content using JavaScript.

Feature-

Dynamic Content Loading: JavaScript is used to dynamically switch between different sections (Home, Login, Registration, Catalogue, Cart) without reloading the entire page.
HTML & CSS: The structure is based on HTML div elements, and styled using basic CSS to create a clean and professional layout.


Pages & Sections-

Home Page: Welcome message to the online bookstore with navigation to other sections.
Login Page: A basic login form to simulate user authentication.
Registration Page: A simple form for user registration (no actual backend functionality).
Catalogue Page: A list of book categories (CSE, ECE, EEE, Civil Engineering).
Cart Page: added books with prices are displayed.
